# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard---Meriskill-Internship
I analyzed a large sales dataset to identify trends and top-performing products. Calculated key revenue metrics and developed clear data visualizations. Used advanced data techniques to extract insights and recommended strategies for sales optimization, demonstrating proficiency in analytical decision-making for business.

## Project Structure:
- Data: Contains the raw data files used for analysis.
- Scripts: Includes any scripts or code used in the data transformation process.
- Visualizations: Stores the Power BI files and exported images of visualizations.
- Docs: Documentation files, including this README.

## Insights:
In order to come up with this visualization, I used Power Query Editor in Power Bi to initially transform unorganized data before creating this visualization. Then, using the order date column, I generated the calculative column for the month name, month number, day name, and day number.
- Created a "Month Name" column from the date column in order to view monthly analysis.
- Created a "Day Name" column from the date column to identify the days of the week products were purchased.
